# Crypto-Coin-Wallet
My first project, an app created to see the value of your different crypto currencies


Using several packages, a simple crypto wallet can be created pulling in data from a database with your cryptos, or manually updated taking
prices from coin market cap 

Run Coin DB before running project if you want to connect a database/input coins before creating app
